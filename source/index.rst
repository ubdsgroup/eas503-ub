* Homework assignments will be assigned for each module. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of class.
* Homework and programming assignments will be graded and returned to students.
* Late submission of assignments will receive a grade of zero.
* Students are encouraged to discuss assignments and share ideas, but each student must independently write and submit their own solution.
* Makeup exams will be given in the following circumstances only: 
  1. You contact the instructor prior to the exam
  2. You have a valid and documented reason to miss the exam

Accessibility Services and Special Needs
-----------------------------------------
If you have a disability and may require some type of instructional and/or examination accommodation, please inform me early in the semester so that we can coordinate the accommodations you may need. If you have not already done so, please contact the Office of Accessibility Services (formerly the Office of Disability Services) University at Buffalo, 25 Capen Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260-1632; email: stu-accessibility@ buffalo.edu Phone: 716-645-2608 (voice); 716-645-2616 (TTY); Fax: 716-645-3116; and on the web at http://www.buffalo.edu/accessibility/. All information and documentation is confidential. The University at Buffalo and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are committed to ensuring equal opportunity for persons with special needs to participate in and benefit from all of its programs, services and activities.

Academic Integrity
-------------------
This course will operate with a zero-tolerance policy regarding cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty. Any act of academic dishonesty will subject the student to penalty, including the high probability of failure of the course (i.e., assignment of a grade of “F”). It is expected that you will behave in an honorable and respectful way as you learn and share ideas. Therefore, recycled papers, work submitted to other courses, and major assistance in preparation of assignments without identifying and acknowledging such assistance are not acceptable. All work for this course must be original for this course. Additionally, you are not allowed to post course homeworks, exams, solutions, etc., on a public forum. Please be familiar with the University and the School policies regarding plagiarism. Read the Academic Integrity Policy and Procedure for more information: http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.shtml.
